# JSON files

This folder is for all json files used in the `/scripts` and /src/components folders.

## Static JSON files

Some files have been pre-generated and their contents should not change.
The static `.json` files are:

- api.json
- colors.json
- splashkit-color-palette.json

## Dynamic JSON files

Other files are updated dynamically using the scripts. Take note of when these change to check that you haven't made unwanted changes. They should only change if a relevant change has been made related to those files.
The dynamic `.json` files are:

- beyond-splashkit-groups.json
- guides-groups.json
- guides.json
