To contribute a function usage example, you need to create the following files:

- **Text file** (.txt) containing a title and short description of the example.
- **Output Image/Video file** showing the expected output of the example. This output file needs to be one of the following:
  - **Image file** (.png)
  - **Gif file** (.gif) if the example code is interactive
  - **Webm file** (.webm) if there is audio in the code example.
- **Code files** with the example code. This must be a complete code example, not just a snippet of code.
- ***Zip file*** (*only if your code requires resource files*) containing the "Resources" folder created with the `skm resources` command, with any resources needed for your example code to run. (More info about adding this at the end.)

## File Location

Place the following files into the folder with the **unique global name** located in `/public/usage-examples/<category folder of the function>`:

- The `.txt` text file.
- The `.cpp` and `.cs` and `.py` code files.

eg. For the `write_line` examples mentioned below, these would be located in `/public/usage-examples/terminal/`.

## File Naming

To allow the files to be used to automatically generate the usage example MDX page, you need to follow a specific format when naming your files.

Here is an example of files for two code examples added for the `write_line` function that are demonstrating the use of `void write_line(string line);`:

```plaintext
write_line-1-example-oop.cs
write_line-1-example-top-level.cs
write_line-1-example-sk.cpp
write_line-1-example-beyond.cpp
write_line-1-example.png
write_line-1-example.py
write_line-1-example.txt
write_line-2-example-oop.cs
write_line-2-example-top-level.cs
write_line-2-example.cpp
write_line-2-example.png
write_line-2-example.py
write_line-2-example.txt
```

Breaking down the first file name from above:

```plaintext
write_line-1-example-oop.cs
    ^      ^    ^     ^   ^-: file type: .cs
    |      |    |     |
    |      |    |     ------: specifies this is a C# OOP example
    |      |    |
    |      |    ------------: designates the file as an example
    |      |      
    |      -----------------: number id of example: 1
    |                         (used to separate examples)
    |
    ------------------------: function name: write_line
                              (created using the "unique_global_name" key
                              from SplashKit's "api.json" file, in "scripts/json-files")
```

## File Contents

### Text file

The text file needs to include:

- Name of the example program
- (Optional) Link to Resources (See the "Adding Zip File Resources" section below)

Here is an example of the contents of the `write_line-2-example.txt` file:

```plaintext
ASCII Art - Charlie the Unicorn
```

### Output Image/Gif/Audio file

Add a screenshot of the output of the example program.

- If the example program includes user input or any movement, please create a Gif showing the program running.
- If the example program includes audio, please create a Webm file showing the program running. You can use a tool such as [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to convert your video files to `.webm` files.

Remove identifying details from the image/gif/audio where possible.

### Code file(s)

Please follow the guidelines below:

- All of the example code needs to be in a single file.
- Example code should be able to be run by copying the code into an empty code file.
- Make sure to include 5 code files:
  1. `.cpp` file using SplashKit
  2. `.cpp` file using Beyond SplashKit (without SplashKit)
  3. `.cs` file using top-level statements style
  4. `.cs` file using object-oriented style
  5. `.py` file

## Adding Zip File Resources

If you have created an example with specific image/sound/etc files, you will need to create and add a zip file containing this folder.

### Zip file contents

Make sure that you have run the `skm resources` command, and put your resource files inside the relevant folder (eg. images).

Then compress/zip the "Resources" folder and give it a relevant name for when users download this file (similar to exisiting examples' resource zip files).

### Linking to the Resources

In the text `.txt` file for your example, add a "note" callout at the end that links to the zip file using the following template:

```plaintext
:::note
To test this example code you can download these [**Resources**](/usage-examples/<category>/<your-zip-file-name>.zip).
:::
```

Then update the link in the template above to add the `<category>`, `<unique-global-name>` and `<your-zip-file-name>`.

eg. For the first `draw_bitmap_named` example that has been created, the text file contents would look like this:

```plaintext
Basic Bitmap Drawing

:::note
To test this example code you can download these [**Resources**](/usage-examples/graphics/draw_bitmap_named-1-example-resources.zip).
:::
```
