## Solution(s)

### 1: Check Internet Connection

Make sure your device is connected to the internet, as this command depends on a stable connection to access the script online.

---

### 2: Temporarily Disable Firewall

Sometimes, a firewall may block the terminal from downloading content. To check if this is the issue, temporarily disable your firewall.

Once the installation completes, you can re-enable the firewall for security.

---

### 3: Manually Download and Run the Script

If the command still doesn’t respond, you can manually download and execute the script as follows:

<Steps>

1. Go to the [skm-install.sh script](https://github.com/splashkit/skm/blob/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh).
2. Click the “Download raw file” button (see below):

3. Save the file to an easily accessible location, such as the Downloads folder.
4. Open Terminal and type the command `bash` (with a space after the word).
5. Drag the downloaded file from the file manager into the Terminal window, then press **Enter** to run it.

</Steps>
