When trying to use a `dotnet` command in the terminal, you may encounter the error `Command 'dotnet' not found`:

## Solution(s)

### 1. Download and install .NET (version 8 or 9)

Download and install [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) if you haven't already.

Then close and reopen your terminal to test the command again.

### 2. Add the '.dotnet' folder to your PATH

To add 'dotnet' to your PATH, run the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="shell-profile">
<TabItem label="Bash Users">

```shell
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:\$HOME/.dotnet\"" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export PATH=\"\$DOTNET_ROOT:\$HOME/.dotnet\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Zsh Users">

```zsh
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:\$HOME/.dotnet\"" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export PATH=\"\$DOTNET_ROOT:\$HOME/.dotnet\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 3. Update permissions

If you are still having issues, try following the steps on the [3. .zshrc permission issues](/troubleshoot/macos/issue-2-zshrc-permission-issues) page first, then come back to repeat the steps above.
