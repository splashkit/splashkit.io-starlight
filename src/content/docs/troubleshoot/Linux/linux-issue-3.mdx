:::note

This error can also occur due to various package issues, which might give you an error for a different package, this often stems from outdated or corrupted dependencies in the default repository.

## Solution(s)

### 1. Update/upgrade dependencies

Follow the steps below to resolve the issue by upgrading dependencies or linking to updated repositories.

<Steps>

1. **Step 1: Update System Repositories**

    Ensure your system's package repositories are up-to-date by running the following command:

    ```shell
    sudo pacman -Syu
    ```

    This will synchronize your system with the latest versions of all installed packages.

2. **Step 2: Use `pamac` to Update Without AUR Packages**

    If the issue persists due to `SDL2_image` dependencies (e.g., `libjxl`), use `pamac` to update the package cache and repositories linked to newer dependency versions:

    ```shell
    pamac update --no-aur
    ```

    This command ensures that your system links to updated repositories and fetches the latest dependencies for `SDL2_image`.

3. **Step 3: Verify Installation of `SDL2_image` Dependencies**

    To manually check if `libjxl` and other related dependencies are installed, run:

    ```shell
    pamac install libjxl
    sudo pacman -S sdl2_image
    ```

    These commands will ensure that the necessary libraries for SplashKit are correctly installed.

4. **Step 4: Retry `skm global install`**

    After updating the dependencies, retry the SplashKit global installation:

    ```shell
    skm global install
    ```

    If the dependencies were resolved correctly, the installation should now complete without errors.

</Steps>

#### Additional Notes

If you encounter further errors, verify your system's library paths and ensure `libSplashKit.so` is correctly located by running:

```shell
sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib
```
