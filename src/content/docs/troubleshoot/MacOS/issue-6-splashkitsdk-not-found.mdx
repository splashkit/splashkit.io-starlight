:::caution[Issue:]

When running a SplashKit C# project on macos, an error may appear that mentions: `The type or namespace 'SplashKitSDK' could not be found`.

This happens when the SplashKit dotnet package has not been added to the project.

:::

## Solution(s)

### 1. Add the SplashKit package to your project

To resolve this error, run the following command in the directory where your project is located:

```shell
dotnet add package SplashKit
```

You should now see "SplashKit" mentioned in your `.csproj` file.

Confirm this has been successful by running the `dotnet run` command again.
