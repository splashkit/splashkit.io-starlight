:::caution[Issue:]

When attempting to run a program that uses SplashKit on MacOS, you may encounter the following error message: `System.DllNotFoundException unable to load DLL splashkit.dll`.

This issue is often related to using a version of OSX older than 13 (macOS Ventura).

:::

---

## Solution(s)

### 1. Update your macOS software

Firstly, update your macOS to the latest version available. Ideally, your OS should be "macOS Ventura" (13) or later, as compatibility issues with `splashkit.dll` are less likely with more recent versions of macOS.

---

### 2: Build the SplashKit library locally

Run the following command to build the library for your OS, which will overwrite the provided library file from when you installed SplashKit:

```shell
skm macos install
```

Then, if needed, re-install the library globally with the following command:

```shell
skm global install
```

---

### 3: Use an older version of SplashKit

If you are using a version of macOS older than 12.0, you can revert SplashKit to a previous version that may be more compatible with your system. Run the following commands in Terminal, one line at a time:

```shell
cd ~/.splashkit
```

```shell
git fetch --unshallow
```

```shell
git checkout cbb68dc
```

#### Using SplashKit with Solution 3

When using SplashKit with this older version above, you will need to use `skm` at the start of any compiling/building commands, or when running C# programs.

Here are the most common commands you might use:

- `skm dotnet new console`: create a new C# terminal project in the current working directory. (See note below)
- `skm dotnet build`: compile the project in the current working directory.
- `skm dotnet run`: build if needed, then execute your program.

:::note
After these commands, using `skm dotnet new` might affect the structure of SplashKit project files. Instead, you can use this [Template SplashKit Project](/resources/troubleshooting/Template_SplashKit_Project.zip) (*zipped folder*) for creating new projects.

<Steps>

1. Unzip the downloaded template.
2. Read the “`README.txt`” file for guidance on setting up new projects.
3. Review the `Program.cs` file, which includes a comment to help configure the project. Once set up, you can remove the comment lines.

</Steps>
