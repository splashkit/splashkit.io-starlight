:::caution[Issue:]

When adding the SplashKit NuGet package to your project using `dotnet add package splashkit`, you get an error that looks like this:

![dotnet add package splashkit error](/images/troubleshoot/macos/dotnet-add-package-error.png)

## Solution(s)

To resolve this error, ensure your project (and folder) is NOT named "SplashKit".

<Steps>

1. **Rename Your Project Folder**

    Make sure the folder where you create your SplashKit project does not have the name “SplashKit”.

    Choose a unique name for the folder, as the project name is automatically derived from it.

2. **Recreate the Project (if needed)**

    If the error persists, try recreating the project in a new folder with a different name to avoid any cached references to the previous setup.

</Steps>

Following these steps should eliminate the naming conflict, allowing your SplashKit project to compile and run without the assembly reference error.
