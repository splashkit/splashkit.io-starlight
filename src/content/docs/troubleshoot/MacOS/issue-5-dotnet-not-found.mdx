## Solution(s)

### 1. Download and install .NET (version 8 or 9)

Download and install [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) if you haven't already.

Then close and reopen your terminal to test the command again.

---

### 2. Add the 'dotnet' path to your PATH

To add 'dotnet' to your PATH, run the following command:

```zsh
echo "export PATH=\"/usr/local/share/dotnet:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 3. Update permissions

If you are still having issues, try following the steps on the [3. .zshrc permission issues](/troubleshoot/macos/issue-2-zshrc-permission-issues) page first, then come back to repeat the steps above.
