:::caution[Issue:]

When trying to use `skm` in the terminal, you may encounter the error `zsh: command not found: skm`, indicating that the `.splashkit` directory is not included in your PATH.

## Solution(s)

### 1: Add SplashKit path to your PATH

<Steps>

1. To add SplashKit to your PATH, run the following command:

    ```shell
    echo "export PATH=\"$HOME/.splashkit:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

2. Open a new terminal, and run the following command to install SplashKit in the default global locations:

    ```shell
    skm global install
    ```

    :::note[Using OSX version older than 12.3?]

    If using an OSX version pre-12.3, you will need to build the library locally. You can do this by running:

    ```shell
    skm macos install
    ```
