:::caution[Issue:]

When trying to use `code .` in the terminal, you may encounter the error `zsh: command not found: code`, indicating that the path to the Visual Studio Code 'code' command is not included in your PATH.

## Solution(s)

### 1. Ensure Visual Studio Code is in Applications folder

Check your "Applications" folder contains the "Visual Studio Code" app.

If it is missing from this folder, find where it is currently located and drag the file into the Applications folder.

---

### 2. Add the 'code' path to your PATH

If you are having issues getting the `code` command to work, an alternative method you can try is to run the following command (adapted from the [Alternative Manual Instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_alternative-manual-instructions) section).

```zsh
echo "export PATH=\"\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

---

### 3. Update permissions

If you are still having issues, try following the steps on the [2. .zshrc permission issues](/troubleshoot/macos/issue-2-zshrc-permission-issues) page first, then come back to repeat the steps above.
