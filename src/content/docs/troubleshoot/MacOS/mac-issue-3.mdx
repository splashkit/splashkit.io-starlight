:::caution[Issue:]

The `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)` command shows an error message near the end that looks similar to either of the following images:

![Terminal window showing Operation not permitted for .zshrc file](/images/troubleshoot/macos/file-locked.png)

## Solution(s)

### 1: Update File Permissions using Terminal

<Steps>

1. Open the Terminal App, and run the following command:

    ```shell
    sudo chmod a=rw ~/.zshrc
    ```

    :::note
    If the error message mentions a different file such as `.bash_profile`, then you will use that file in the command above instead of the `.zshrc` file used in this example.
    :::

2. Remove the existing `.splashkit` folder by running the following command:

    ```shell
    rm -rf ~/.splashkit
    ```

3. Close and reopen the Terminal, and run the initial install script command again:

    ```shell
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
    ```

If you still have issues, try the steps below:

### 2: Update File Permissions using Finder

To resolve this issue using Finder rather than the terminal, you can update the file permissions with the following steps:

<Steps>

1. Open Finder.
2. Click on "Go" at the top of the screen, then "Home":

3. Click into the **Macintosh HD** (or similar) folder, then the **Users** folder, and finally, click into the folder with your computer's username.
4. Show the hidden files with the shortcut: `Shift` + `Command` + `.` and you should be able to scroll down to see the file mentioned in the terminal error.

    Here is an example to show the hidden `.zshrc` file mentioned in the screenshots above:

    :::note
    If the error message mentions a different file such as `.bash_profile`, then you will edit that file instead of the `.zshrc` file used in this example.
    :::

5. Right-click on the file and then select "**Get Info**".  
    You will see something that looks similar to this:

    ![Get info window for .zshrc file](/images/troubleshoot/macos/get-info-zshrc.png)

6. Check the information in the orange boxes shown in the image above:

   - Make sure the "**Locked**" checkbox is **not** ticked (as shown above).
   - Make sure the file has "**Read & Write**" Privileges for at least your username, but sometimes you may need to change all of them to Read & Write.

7. Close the Info window.
8. Open your terminal and run the SplashKit installation script command again:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
    ```

9. If you get a message the SplashKit is already installed, copy the text to uninstall (highlighted in the image below - yours will have a different username):

    ![Terminal window showing splashkit already installed](/images/troubleshoot/macos/skm-already-installed.png)

10. Paste and run the command to uninstall SplashKit.
11. Close and re-open the Terminal and run the SplashKit installation script command again.
12. SplashKit should now be able to install successfully, so you can continue on with the next installation step.

</Steps>
