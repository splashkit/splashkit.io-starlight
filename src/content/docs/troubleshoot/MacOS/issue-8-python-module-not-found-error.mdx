:::caution[Issue:]

When running python SplashKit code, you can an error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'splashkit' in Python`:

![ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'splashkit' in Python](/images/troubleshoot/macos/macos-issue-7_problem.png)

MacOS prioritises its built-in Python installation located in `/usr/bin/python3`. SplashKit and other dependencies are likely installed in the Python environment managed by Homebrew, which is located at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` or similar. Due to this, the SplashKit module cannot be located in shellâ€™s PATH environment variable.

## Solution(s)

### 1. Install python using homebrew

If you haven't installed homebrew, or homebrew's python package, follow the steps below:

<Steps>

1. Install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation).
2. Install [python, using homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python@3.13) with the following command:

   ```shell
   brew install python@3.13
   ```

3. Add homebrew to your path using the following command:

   ```zsh
   echo "eval \"\$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"" >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. Verify that the terminal is using the Homebrew-installed Python version:

   ```shell
   which python3
   ```

   The output should be something like:

   ```plaintext
   /opt/homebrew/bin/python3
   ```

5. Run your Python code again. It should now successfully locate the SplashKit module.

</Steps>

After completing these steps, your terminal will use the Homebrew-installed version of Python, and your Python script should now successfully find and run the SplashKit module without encountering the `ModuleNotFoundError`.
