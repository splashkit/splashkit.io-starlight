:::caution[Issue:]

You have issues with the WSL (with **Ubuntu**) installation, such as:

- No window pops up after restarting your computer (after running the `wsl --install` command)
- You accidentally closed the Ubuntu window before it finished
- You made a mistake when creating your username or password
- You get an error that might look similar to this:

:::

## Solution(s)

### 1. Reset Ubuntu user account

Reset your Ubuntu user account with the following steps:

<Steps>

1. Open a **Powershell** Terminal window.
2. Run the following command to reset the Ubuntu setup:

    ```bash
    wsl --unregister Ubuntu
    ```

3. Then run the install command again:

    ```bash
    wsl --install
    ```

4. Close all Terminal/Powershell windows.
5. Open the Ubuntu app (search in the start menu)

</Steps>

This should then open a Terminal window that will start ***Installing Ubuntu*** again, and then you can set up your username and password again.

:::note[Password not showing]
Note that when you enter your new password in the terminal, it won't show any output, but it is reading the keyboard input.
:::

If you still have issues, doing steps 1-4 above, and then restart your computer before doing step 5.
