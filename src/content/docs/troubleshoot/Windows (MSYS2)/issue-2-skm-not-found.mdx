:::caution[Issue:]

When trying to use `skm` in the terminal, you may see the error message `-bash: skm: command not found`. This usually indicates that the system cannot locate the `skm` executable, likely due to a missing path entry.

4. **Add Required Paths for SplashKit**

    In the “Edit Environment Variable” window, click **New** and then add the paths below (replacing `livmc` with your own username):

    ```plaintext
    C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
    C:\msys64\home\livmc\.splashkit
    C:\msys64\home\livmc\.splashkit\lib\win64
    ```

    Once the paths are added, click **OK** on all open windows to save your changes.

5. **Verify the Update**  

    Open a **new** MINGW64 terminal and run your program to confirm the paths have been correctly set and that SplashKit functions as expected.
