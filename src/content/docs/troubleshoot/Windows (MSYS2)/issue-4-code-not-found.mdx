## Solution(s)

### 1. Restart MINGW64 Terminal

Close all open terminal windows and then open a **new** MINGW64 terminal window and try running the `code .` command again.

### 2: Add 'code' path to your PATH variable

Follow these steps to update your system “Path” variable:

<Steps>

1. **Open Environment Variables Settings**  

    Use the taskbar search bar to type “environment variables”.

    Select the matching result, as shown below.

    :::tip[Finding your username]

    To find your username for the paths in the next steps, open File Explorer or type `whoami` in the terminal to confirm your username.

4. **Add Required Path for VS Code**

    In the “Edit Environment Variable” window, click **New** and then add the path below (replacing `livmc` with your own username):

    ```plaintext
    C:\Users\livmc\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin
    ```

    {/* TODO: Add image with path */}

    Once the path is added, click **OK** on all open windows to save your changes.

5. **Verify the Update**  

    Open a **new** MINGW64 terminal and run your program to confirm the paths have been correctly set and that SplashKit functions as expected.
