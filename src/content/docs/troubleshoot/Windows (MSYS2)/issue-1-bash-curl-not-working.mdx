## Solution(s)

### 1: Check Internet Connection

Make sure your device is connected to the internet, as this command depends on a stable connection to access the script online.

---

### 2: Temporarily Disable Firewall

Your firewall may be blocking the script from running. Try temporarily disabling your firewall:

<Steps>

1. Open **Control Panel** and navigate to **System and Security** > **Windows Defender Firewall**.
2. Select **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** and choose **Turn off** for both Private and Public networks.
3. Run the command again in your terminal, then re-enable the firewall after the installation.

</Steps>

### 3: Manually Download and Run the Script

If the command still doesn’t respond, you can manually download and execute the script as follows:

<Steps>

1. Go to the [skm-install.sh script](https://github.com/splashkit/skm/blob/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh).
2. Click the “Download raw file” button as shown below:

3. Save the file to a location you can easily access, such as your **Downloads** folder.
4. Open the **MINGW64** terminal and type `bash` (with a space at the end).
5. Drag the downloaded file from **File Explorer** into the terminal window to add its path, as shown here:

6. Press **Enter** to run the script. This should complete the installation of `skm`, allowing you to continue with the tutorial from the next step.

</Steps>

These steps should allow you to successfully run the `skm` installation script on Windows. If issues persist, refer to the additional troubleshooting guides or contact support.
