### 2: Add 'dotnet' path to your PATH variable

Follow these steps to update your system “Path” variable:

<Steps>

1. **Open Environment Variables Settings**

    Once the path is added, click **OK** on all open windows to save your changes.

5. **Verify the Update**  

    Open a **new** MINGW64 terminal and run your program to confirm the paths have been correctly set and that SplashKit functions as expected.
