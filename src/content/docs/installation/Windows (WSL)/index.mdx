:::tip[Using the Programmer's Field Guide?]

If you are using the Field Guide, we *strongly recommend* that you follow its installation guide:

- [Set up my Windows (with WSL)](https://programmers.guide/book/appendix/0-installation/2-6-setup-win-wsl/)

This guide also includes an automated script for an easier installation option.

To get SplashKit installed on Windows, follow the four steps:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Install WSL and Command Line Tools"
    description="Step 1"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/1-command-line-tools/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install Language Specific Tools"
    description="Step 2"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/2-language-tools/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install SplashKit"
    description="Step 3"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/3-splashkit/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install Visual Studio Code"
    description="Step 4"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/4-vscode/"
  />
</CardGrid>

Once you have all of these steps complete you should be setup and ready to
start building SplashKit applications in the language of your choice.
