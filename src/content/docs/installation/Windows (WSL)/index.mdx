To get SplashKit installed on Windows, follow the four steps:

import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
  title="Install WSL and Command Line Tools"
  description="Step 1"
  href="/installation/windows-wsl/step-1/"
  />
  <LinkCard
  title="Install SplashKit"
  description="Step 2"
  href="/installation/windows-wsl/step-2/"
  />
  <LinkCard
  title="Install Visual Studio Code"
  description="Step 3"
  href="/installation/windows-wsl/step-3/"
  />
  <LinkCard
  title="Install Language Specific Tools"
