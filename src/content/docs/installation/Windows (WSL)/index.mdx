To get SplashKit installed on Windows, follow the four steps:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard

    description="Step 1"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/1-command-line-tools/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install Language Specific Tools"
    description="Step 2"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/2-language-tools/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install SplashKit"
    description="Step 3"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/3-splashkit/"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Install Visual Studio Code"
    description="Step 4"
    href="/installation/windows-wsl/4-vscode/"
