[SplashKit](https://splashkit.io) is a beginnerâ€™s all-purpose software toolkit that will allow you to create fun and exciting programs more easily, especially for Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs.

Follow these steps to set up SplashKit on WSL and start building interactive, visually appealing applications on Windows!

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

1. **Run the SplashKit Installer**

   Open your WSL/Ubuntu Terminal and paste the following command to download and install SplashKit:

   ```shell
   bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
   ```

2. **Verify the Installation**

   Restart your terminal to ensure the new installation path is recognized, then run the following command to confirm SplashKit Manager (`skm`) is installed:

    ```shell
    skm
    ```

    You should see messages confirming the installation:

    ```shell
    SplashKit is installed successfully!
    Missing skm command. For help use 'skm help'
    ```

    *Tip:* Use `skm help` to explore additional commands for managing SplashKit.
