SplashKit requires several command line tools to be installed on your system before you proceed with the installation. Follow the steps below to install these tools, then you can continue with the SplashKit installation.

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) is a feature of Windows that lets you run a Linux environment on your Windows machine without needing a virtual machine or dual-boot setup.

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

1. **Install WSL (Ubuntu)**

   ### Method 1: Command Line (Recommended)

   To install both WSL and Ubuntu from the command line, follow these steps. Open Terminal, PowerShell, or Command Prompt in *administrator mode* by right-clicking and selecting "Run as administrator," then enter the command below:

   ```shell
   wsl --install
   ```

   ### Method 2: Microsoft Store (Alternative)

   Alternatively, you can install WSL (and Ubuntu) directly from the Microsoft Store.

   - Search "WSL" in the Microsoft Store app, or [click here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9P9TQF7MRM4R).
   - Next, download **Ubuntu** from the Microsoft Store. Search "Ubuntu," or [click this link](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9PDXGNCFSCZV).

2. **Create Ubuntu User Account**

   Restart your computer if you haven’t already. After restarting, a terminal window will open to finish Ubuntu setup. If it doesn’t, open the WSL or Ubuntu app manually.

   When prompted, enter a UNIX username and password.  
   For example, if you choose the username "**default-user**," your terminal will look like this:

   :::tip[Troubleshooting Installation Issues]
   If you have issues installing WSL with Ubuntu, reset the installation by entering:

   ```shell
   wsl --unregister Ubuntu
   ```

   Then, reinstall using:

   ```shell
   wsl --install
   ```

   Lastly, open Ubuntu again to create your user account.

3. **(Optional) Configure Windows Terminal for WSL**

   To have the Windows **Terminal** app automatically open with WSL, you can set the *Default profile* to WSL (Ubuntu).

   - Open the Terminal app, click the drop-down arrow at the top of the window, then click "Settings."
   - In *Default profile*, select an **Ubuntu** profile. Choose the profile with the Linux penguin icon if available.
   - Click **Save** to apply changes.

4. **Install Command Line Tools**

   First, update the package lists:

   ```shell
   sudo apt update
   ```

   Next, install the tools:

   ```shell
   sudo apt install git curl clang
   ```
