## Steps

1. Download the latest version of the .NET SDK for macOS from the official .NET website: [dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

2. Run the downloaded installer and follow on-screen instructions.

3. Restart your terminal, and run the following command to check it is installed:

    ```shell
    dotnet --version
    ```
