[SplashKit](https://splashkit.io) is a beginnerâ€™s all-purpose software toolkit that will allow you to create fun and exciting programs more easily, especially for Graphical User Interface (GUI) programs.

Follow these steps to set up SplashKit on macOS and begin building interactive, visually appealing applications!

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

1. **Run the SplashKit Installer**

   Open your Terminal and paste the following command to download and install SplashKit:

   ```shell
   bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/splashkit/skm/master/install-scripts/skm-install.sh)
   ```

   :::tip[Fingerprint Authentication]

   If you want to use fingerprint authentication when the installation needs elevated permissions, rather than typing your password each time, run the following command in your terminal *(**before running the command above**)*:

   ```shell
   sed "s/^#auth/auth/" /etc/pam.d/sudo_local.template | sudo tee /etc/pam.d/sudo_local
   ```

   :::

2. **Verify the Installation**

   Restart your Terminal to ensure the new installation path is recognized. Then, enter the following command to check if SplashKit Manager (`skm`) is installed:

   ```shell
   skm
   ```

   You should see a message confirming the installation:

   ```shell
   SplashKit is installed successfully!
   Missing skm command. For help, use 'skm help'
   ```

   *Tip:* Use `skm help` to explore additional commands for managing SplashKit.

</Steps>

:::note[Optional Installation Commands]

The commands below are run in the initial installation script, and therefore are not required to be run unless you experience issues.

- To install the necessary dependencies and build the SplashKit library natively on macOS, use:

   ```shell
   skm macos install
   ```

- To install SplashKit into the system global directories, use:

   ```shell
   skm global install
   ```
