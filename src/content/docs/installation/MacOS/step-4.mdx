SplashKit supports multiple programming languages, each with its own set of tools. Follow the instructions below to install the required tools for your chosen language.

## Language-Specific Installations

### C# (.NET)

To develop with C# in SplashKit, you’ll need to install the .NET SDK.

<Steps>

1. **Download the .NET SDK**  

   Go to the [official .NET download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and download the latest version of the .NET SDK for macOS.

2. **Install the .NET SDK**  

   Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Verify the Installation**  

   Restart your terminal to ensure the SDK is recognized, then run the following command to confirm the installation:

    ```shell
    dotnet --version
    ```

   If installed correctly, this command will output the version number of the .NET SDK.

</Steps>

### For C++

For C++, you (should) _already_ be ready to go.

### Python

To develop with Python in SplashKit, you’ll need Python 3 installed. You can easily install Python 3 using Homebrew.

<Steps>

1. **Install Homebrew** (if not already installed)  

   Open your terminal and enter the following command to install Homebrew:

   ```shell
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. **Install Python 3**  

   Use Homebrew to install Python 3:

   ```shell
   brew install python
   ```

3. **Verify Installation (Optional)**

   Check that Python 3 and `pip3` (Python’s package installer) are correctly installed by running:

   ```shell
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

   Both commands should output version information if the installation was successful.

</Steps>

### Other Languages

Support for other languages such as Rust and Pascal are coming soon.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've completed the setup of language-specific tools for SplashKit. You're now ready to start developing.
