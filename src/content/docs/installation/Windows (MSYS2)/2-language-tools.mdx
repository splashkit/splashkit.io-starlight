SplashKit supports multiple programming languages, each with its own set of tools. Follow the steps below to install the necessary tools for your chosen language.

## Language-Specific Installations

### C# (.NET)

To develop with C# in SplashKit, youâ€™ll need to install the .NET SDK.

<Steps>

1. **Download the .NET SDK**  

   Go to the [official .NET SDK download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and download the latest version for Windows.

2. **Install the .NET SDK**  

   Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. **Verify the Installation**

   Open your MSYS2 terminal and run the following command to confirm that .NET is installed:

    ```shell
    dotnet --version
    ```

   If installed correctly, this command will output the version number of the .NET SDK.

</Steps>

### C++

For C++ development, your MSYS2 setup already includes the necessary tools for SplashKit. No additional setup is required specifically for C++.

### Python

To develop with Python in SplashKit, follow these steps to install Python on your system.

<Steps>

1. **Download the Python Installer**

   Go to the [Python download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest Python installer for Windows.

2. **Run the Installer and Select Optional Features**  

   - During the installation, check the box to **Add python.exe to PATH**.
   - Choose additional features, such as installing `pip`, as needed.

3. **Complete the Installation**  

   Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

4. **Verify Installation (Optional)**  

    To confirm that `Python` and `pip` are successfully installed, open your MSYS2 terminal and run the following commands:

    ```shell
    python --version
    pip --version
    ```

   Both commands should output version information if the installation was successful.
