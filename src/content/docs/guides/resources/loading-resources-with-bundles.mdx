Games often require a large number of resources. With different levels, characters, animations, music, and sound effects, it can be cumbersome to have to load each of these individually in your code. To help overcome this, SplashKit provides bundles.

## Preparing Resources

To use resources effectively in SplashKit, you need to organise your resource files in the correct structure. Follow these steps to create the necessary resources folder:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command to generate the resources folder and its subfolders:

```bash
skm resources
```

This command creates the resources folder, which organises different types of assets needed for your project. This includes images, sounds, animations, fonts, and JSON files. For instance, the `json` subfolder is where you place any JSON files you intend to use.

---

## Bundle Contents

The bundle scripts are located in the _Resources/bundles_ folder. Each script is a text file that contains the details of the resources to load. Each line of the file describes a single resource, with comma separated fields. The first field contains the type of resource to load being one of the following:

- **ANIM** to load an animation
- **BITMAP** to load an image
- **BUNDLE** to load another bundle
- **FONT** to load a font
- **MUSIC** to load music
- **SOUND** to load a sound effect
- **TIMER** to create a timer.

Following the resource kind is the resources name and the associated filename for the resource. The name is used to access the resource once the bundle is loaded, while the filename indicates which resource to load. You need to ensure that the names are unique for each resource otherwise some of the resources will not be accessible.

---

## Extra Details

Bitmap and font resources also require additional information.

**BITMAP** can optionally be followed by bitmap cell details useful for animations. This is in the format: `BITMAP, name, filename, width, height, cellCols, cellRows, cellCount`. Once the bitmap is loaded the bundle will set the cell details from the information given.

See [Using Animations](/guides/animations/using-animations) guide for more details, and example code and files to test.

**FONT** must be followed by the point size for the font.

---

## Example

The following is an example of a bundle script file, it includes an example of each resource kinds you can load in SplashKit.

```plaintext
BITMAP,mySpriteSheet,image1_name.png, 500, 100, 10, 2, 19
BITMAP,myBitmap,image2_name.png
ANIM,myAnimation,anim_name.txt
SOUND,mySound,sound_name.wav
MUSIC,myMusic,music_name.ogg
FONT,myFont,font_name.ttf,14
BUNDLE,myBundle,bundle_name.txt
```

As you can see from the example, bundles can load a variety of resources including other bundles. Bitmaps can be loaded with cells and without cells.

---

## Testing Resources

Once your resources are organised and your bundle script is created, you can load and use them in your code. Here's how you can test loading resources:

### Example Code

This is demonstrated in the following code example:

:::note
These examples use functions such as [Load Resources Bundle](/api/resource-bundles/#load-resource-bundle) and [Free Resource Bundle](/api/resource-bundles/#free-resource-bundle).

To test the code below you can download these [**Resources**](/resources/guides/resource-bundles/basics/BasicResourceBundleResources.zip).
