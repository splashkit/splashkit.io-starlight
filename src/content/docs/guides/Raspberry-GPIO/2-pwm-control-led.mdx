Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique for emulating analog signals when using a digital signal source - like the pins we've been using. It does this by rapidly turning the digital pins on and off, effectively controlling the amount of power sent to a device. This method is widely used for controlling lights, motors and other devices. When using PWM we have several parameters we can control and modify: the PWM duty cycle, the PWM frequency and the PWM range.

### PWM Frequency

PWM operates through cycles, which are set by the frequency. The frequency of PWM indicates how many times per second the PWM signal completes one on-and-off cycle. A higher frequency means the individual cycles are completed more rapidly, which can help in smoothing the output in devices like LED's and motors. It is measured in Hertz (Hz) and as it increases, this rapid switching becomes less and less perceptible to human senses. At low frequencies this switching is noticeable and this is seen later in this tutorial.

### PWM Duty Cycle

In each of these cycles, the pin is powered high for a some part of the cycle and unpowered for the other part. We define this through the duty cycle, and this allows for fine control over the amount of power delivered to a device. In this tutorial it is shown that increasing the duty cycle of a PWM signal sent to an LED makes it appear brighter as the LED is on for more of the cycle. This value is often expressed as a percentage, for example a 50% duty cycle means that the signal is on for half of the cycle, and off for the other half.

### PWM Range

The range of the PWM refers to the resolution we can achieve when adjusting the duty cycle. For example, a range of 255 means that the duty cycle can be adjusted in 256 increments so that the pin could be always off (0%) or always on (100%). A larger range allows for more precise control of the output device and we explore this further in the next tutorial.

## Components

### Breadboard

Breadboards are reusable devices used to build and test circuits. They are made up of a number of
holes that are connected by hidden metal strips. Along the top and bottoms are the ground and power
rails, and in the middle there are two sections separated by a channel. Each hole in a section is
connected to the adjacent vertical holes. More information can be found at
[How to Use a Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all).

### LED

An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a device that emits light when an electric current passes through
it. They feature two legs, a longer positive leg (the [anode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anode))
and a shorter negative leg (the [cathode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode)). The longer leg is
often kinked so that both legs protrude the same distance from the LED. To use it we connect the positive
lead to the GPIO pin and the negative lead to a ground pin. More information can be found at
[Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs)](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/light-emitting-diodes-leds/all)

### 220 Ω Resistor

The power that the Raspberry Pi can provide is actually too much for these LEDs. To prevent the LED
from burning out, we must add a resistor to the circuit. The resistor limits the current that
flows through the LED, preventing it from burning out. The exact value of the resistor is not
critical, but too high a value does not allow enough illumination of the LED. A resistor in the
range of 220 Ω to 1 kΩ should work well. More information on resistors can be found at
[Sparkfun - Resistors](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/resistors/all)

:::tip[Resistor Colour Code]
The colours on a resistor indicate the resistance value. Each coloured band corresponds to specific
numbers and multipliers which can be used to calculate the resistance value. More information
can be found at [Electronic Colour Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_color_code)

### Jumper Wires

Jumper Wires, or DuPont wires, are used to make a temporary connection different components. They
can be M/M, M/F, or F/F. We are using M/F jumper wires in this guide.

## The Circuit

Below we can see the circuit diagram for this project. Just like the blink-LED tutorial, we have the cathode of the LED connected to
GPIO Pin 11, while the anode is connected to ground pin 6 through a resistor.

![Circuit Diagram for Blinking an LED](./images/circuits/blinkled.png)

And the physical circuit looks like the following image, in which we've connected an M/F jumper wire
from Pin 11 to the cathode of the LED. The anode of the LED is connected to the resistor, which is
then connected to the ground pin through another M/F jumper wire.

## The Code

:::caution[Before running the code.]
This code requires the `pigpio` daemon, so make sure it is running! For more information see: [Starting the Daemon](/guides/raspberry-gpio/0-blink-led/#starting-the-daemon)

## Changing Frequency

Below is an example program to iterate over the entire range of frequencies available.

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

  ```cpp
  #include "splashkit.h"

  int main()
  {
      const int freqs[] = {10, 20, 40, 50, 80, 100, 160, 200, 250,
                          320, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 1600, 2000, 4000, 8000 };
      const int pwm_range = 255;
      raspi_init();
      pin led_pin = PIN_11;
      raspi_set_mode(led_pin, GPIO_OUTPUT);
      raspi_set_pwm_range(led_pin, pwm_range);
      raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, (pwm_range / 2));
      for(int i = 0; i < 18; i++)
      {
          write("At Frequency: ");
          write_line(freq[i]);
          raspi_set_pwm_frequency(led_pin, freq[i]);
          delay(1000);
      }
      raspi_cleanup();
      return 0;
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Understanding the code

Lets break down this code and look at it in sections.

1.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      const int freqs[] = {10, 20, 40, 50, 80, 100, 160, 200, 250,
                          320, 400, 500, 800, 1000, 1600, 2000, 4000, 8000 };
      const int pwm_range = 255;
      raspi_init();
      pin led_pin = PIN_11;
      raspi_set_mode(led_pin, GPIO_OUTPUT);
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    When using `pigpiod`, we can actually set the sample rate for the daemon, which is a value determining how many times it can read a pin in a second. Each sample rate has a set of available frequencies, with the values defined in freqs array being the available frequencies for the default sample rate (more information can be found at [Pigpio library -`set_PWM_frequency`](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pdif2.html#set_PWM_frequency)).

    So, we define these values in an array and as a constant as these we don't want them changing during the running of the program. We then define a standard range for our PWM, also as a constant, and then we do the usual initialisation of the Raspberry Pi Pins.

2.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      raspi_set_pwm_range(led_pin, pwm_range);
      raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, (pwm_range / 2));
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    In this section we set the PWM range and duty cycles that we are using. We are setting the duty cycle to be half the PWM range, or in other words we're setting it to 50%. We are not changing these values so we can specifically see the effects of changing frequency.

3.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      for(int i = 0; i < 18; i++)
      {
          write("At Frequency: ");
          write_line(freq[i]);
          raspi_set_pwm_frequency(led_pin, freq[i]);
          delay(1000);
      }
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    This part is the main component of the code. We iterate over the previously defined frequencies and write where we're at to the terminal. We then set the PWM to the particular frequency and wait for one second. This delay allows us to see the changes in the LED as the frequency increases. At the beginning there is a noticeable flicker, before the flickering stabilises to full illumination as the frequency increases.

4.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      raspi_cleanup();
      return 0;
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Finally we clean up and exit the program.

We can build this program with the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

  ```shell
  g++ pwm_frequency.cpp -l SplashKit -o pwm_frequency
  ```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

We can then run the program with the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

  ```shell
  ./pwm_frequency
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Running this, you may be able to see a noticeable flicker when the frequency is at a low value but it quickly stabilises as it increases. This happens due to the way our eyes perceive light, specifically the [Persistence of Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision). If the frequency is faster than the time that images remain in our vision, then we do not notice the times when the LED is unlit.

#### Changing Duty Cycle

Below is an example program, very similar to the previous program, that demonstrates what the effect of modifying the duty cycle does to the LED.

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

  ```cpp
  #include "splashkit.h"

  int main()
  {
      const int pwm_range = 255;
      raspi_init();
      pin led_pin = PIN_11;
      raspi_set_mode(led_pin, GPIO_OUTPUT);

      raspi_set_pwm_frequency(led_pin, 1000);
      raspi_set_pwm_range(led_pin, pwm_range);


      for(int i = 0; i <= pwm_range; i += 10)
      {
          write("At Duty Cycle: ");
          write_line(i);
          raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, i);
          delay(1000);
      }

      raspi_cleanup();
      return 0;
  }
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Lets break down this code and look at the sections that are different.

1.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      const int pwm_range = 255;
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Like before we set our PWM range to a constant value. We are using 255 as a general default, but it is important to know that the real range of PWM is dependant on the frequency that we set. More information can be found at [Pigpio library - `set_pwm_range`](https://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pdif2.html#set_PWM_range).

2.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      raspi_set_pwm_frequency(led_pin, 1000);
      raspi_set_pwm_range(led_pin, pwm_range);
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    First we set our frequency, we're are using 1000Hz (which cycles at 1000 times per second). We then set our predefined PWM range, and if we refer back to the Pigpiod library we can see that a frequency of 1000 is the 14th available frequency at the default sample rate. This means that at this frequency we really have a range of 2500 and so our PWM range of 255 is valid.

3.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      for(int i = 0; i <= pwm_range; i += 10)
      {
          write("At Duty Cycle: ");
          write_line(i);
          raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, i);
          delay(1000);
      }
      for(int i = pwm_range; i >= 0; i -= 10)
      {
          write("At Duty Cycle: ");
          write_line(i);
          raspi_set_pwm_dutycycle(led_pin, i);
          delay(1000);
      }
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    In this section we have the main function of this program. We iterate over the range that we've set in increments of 10, and at each step we print out the duty cycle we're currently on. We then set the duty cycle to this value and wait for a second so we can see the changes. We then reverse the loop and iterate back down to zero.

4.
    <Tabs syncKey="code-language">
    <TabItem label="C++">

      ```cpp
      raspi_cleanup();
      return 0;
      ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    Like usual, we clean up and exit the program.

### Build and run the code

We can build this program with the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

  ```shell
  g++ pwm_dutycycle.cpp -l SplashKit -o pwm_dutycycle
  ```
  
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can then run the program with the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

  ```shell
  ./pwm_dutycycle
  ```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Changing the duty cycle results in a noticeable change in the brightness of the LED. This occurs due to there being literally more or less power flowing through the device, resulting in the increase or decrease in brightness. This can be seen in the GIF below.

!["GIF of LED duty cycle changes."](/gifs/guides/gpio-tutorial-gifs/pwm_led.gif)

### Further Information

#### Changing PWM Range

As previously mentioned, when we increase the PWM range we increase the number of steps between the pin being always off and always on. We could change the range in the previous program and observe finer and more subtle adjustments occurring to the LED as the duty cycle increases. But this may be difficult to see when using a regular LED. A more effective demonstration of the capabilities of PWM would be through the use of an RGB LED, which can interpret analog-like signals achieved through PWM to mix red, green, and blue light in varying intensities. This allows for the creation of a wider spectrum of colours by adjusting the PWM range for each of the LED's colour components.
