## Introduction to Vectors

In programming, vectors are used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. They are used in various applications, including graphics, physics simulations, and game development. This tutorial will guide you through the basics of vectors, their applications, and how to visualise them using SplashKit.

## SplashKit Vectors

SplashKit is a powerful game development framework that allows you to create 2D games and simulations with realistic physics. By leveraging SplashKitâ€™s built-in physics engine, developers can create engaging and immersive experiences that mimic the behavior of real-world objects.

## Understanding Vectors in SplashKit

One of the key considerations when working with physics in SplashKit is the coordinate system and axis orientation. SplashKit uses a coordinate system where the y-axis is reversed compared to the traditional Cartesian coordinate system. This means that the positive y-direction points downwards, while the positive x-direction points to the right. Developers must keep this in mind when calculating and applying physics-based forces and movements.

Vectors are mathematical constructs used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction. Unlike scalars, which only have magnitude (like temperature or mass), vectors can describe more complex concepts like displacement, velocity, and force.

2D vectors are represented in programming as pairs of values `(x, y)`. These values give rise to the two key propertise of vectors:

- **Magnitude** - The length or size of the vector.
- **Direction** - The orientation of the vector in space.

### Where and When to Use Vectors

Vectors are essential in many areas of programming, particularly in:

- **Movement**: To represent the direction and speed of an object, such as controlling the path of a character in a game.
- **Forces**: In physics simulations, vectors represent forces acting on objects, such as calculating a bullet trajectory.
- **Graphics**: For drawing shapes, determining object positions, and performing transformations like scaling or rotating objects.

### Vector Usage in Programming

A **position vector** represents the location of a point in 2D space relative to an origin. For example, consider a point located at coordinates `(3, 4)`. This vector indicates that the point is 3 units to the right and 4 units up from the origin `(0, 0)`.

A **velocity vector** represents the speed and direction of an object's motion. For example, if an object is moving to the right and slightly upwards at a speed, it can be represented by the components `(5, 2)`. Here, the vector indicates that the object moves 5 units to the right and 2 units upwards per unit of time.

A **force vector** represents the magnitude and direction of a force acting on an object. For example, if a force is applied downwards and to the left, it might be represented as `(-3, -6)`. The components indicate that the force has a magnitude directed 3 units to the left and 6 units downwards.

## Visualising Vectors

To visualise vectors, we will create a simple program using SplashKit to draw vectors on a Cartesian plane.

<Aside type="note" title="Function">

The `vector_to_string` function converts a vector's x and y components into a readable format. This helps display vector data for debugging or educational purposes.

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
string vector_to_string(const vector_2d &v)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
public static string Vector2D.VectorToString(Vector2D v);
public static string SplashKit.VectorToString(Vector2D v);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
def vector_to_string(v):
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</Aside>

We will first need to declare and initialise a vector with some `x` and `y` values:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
vector_2d my_vector;
my_vector.x = 200;
my_vector.y = 100;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
Vector2D myVector = new Vector2D();
myVector.X = 200;
myVector.Y = 100;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
my_vector = Vector2D()
my_vector.x = 200
my_vector.y = 100
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

- **`vector_2d`** holds two values, x and y, representing the vector's coordinates in 2D space.
- **`my_vector`** is an instance of this structure.
- **`my_vector.x`** and **`my_vector.y`** specify the vector's horizontal and vertical components, respectively. In this example, the vector points to a location that is 200 units to the right and 100 units up from the origin `(0, 0)`.

In our code, we can call the `vector_to_string` function to convert the vector back in to a human-readable string format.

Pulling this all together, we can visualise this vector on a Cartesian plane and view the output of the `vector_to_string` function on the screen.

![Introduction to Vectors](/images/guides/physics/introduction-to-vectors-1.png)

- The vector is drawn on the grid from the origin `(0, 0)` to the point `(200, 100)` on the plane. The output of the `vector_to_string` function is seen in the top left of the screen with the `x` and `y` values.
- The **direction** of the vector is represented by the angle that the line makes with the x-axis. This demonstrates how the vector is oriented in 2D space.
- The **magnitude** of the vector is represented by the length of the red line.

## Creating Vectors from Points

<Aside type="note" title="Function">
  
To create a vector from two specific points in 2D space, we use the `vector_point_to_point` function. This function computes a vector representing the direction and distance from one point to another.

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
vector_2d vector_point_to_point(const point_2d &start, const point_2d &end_pt)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
public static Vector2D Vector2D.VectorPointToPoint(Point2D start, Point2D endPt);
public static Vector2D SplashKit.VectorPointToPoint(Point2D start, Point2D endPt);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
def vector_point_to_point(start, end_pt):
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</Aside>

The `vector_point_to_point` function is useful because it calculates the vector that represents the direction and distance from one point to another. This functionality is particularly valuable in various applications:

- **Character Movement**: In games, this function helps determine the direction and distance a character needs to move to reach a specific destination.
- **Impact Calculations**: When detecting collisions or interactions between objects, you can use `vector_point_to_point` to compute the vector representing the direction of impact.
- **Vector Addition/Subtraction**: You can use the resulting vector from `vector_point_to_point` to perform further vector operations, such as addition or subtraction, to achieve complex transformations.

Let's see it in action. Suppose we have two points, `start` and `end_pt`. To compute the vector from `start` to `end_pt`, you can use:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
point_2d start = {-100, -150};
point_2d end_pt = {100, 150};

vector_2d v = vector_point_to_point(start, end_pt);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
Point2D start = new Point2D { X = -100, Y = -150 };
Point2D endPt = new Point2D { X = 100, Y = 150 };

Vector2D v = SplashKit.VectorPointToPoint(start, endPt);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
start = Point2D()
start.x = -100
start.y = -150

end_pt = Point2D()
end_pt.x = 100
end_pt.y = 150

v = vector_point_to_point(start, end_pt)

## Conclusion

Vectors are an exciting concept in programming that help us represent and manipulate quantities with both magnitude and direction. From positioning objects in 2D space to simulating movement and forces, understanding vectors helps us to create dynamic and interactive applications.
