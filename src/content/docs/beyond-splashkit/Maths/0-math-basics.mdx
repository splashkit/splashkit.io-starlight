Mathematics is a fundamental part of programming, providing essential tools and methods that enable developers to solve complex problems efficiently. This guide explores a range of mathematical operations and demonstrates how to implement them effectively. In later tutorials, you'll learn how to integrate these operations into your SplashKit projects to create programs, games and encrypted messaging applications.

## Basic Maths Operations

This section introduces fundamental mathematical operations that are essential for programming. We'll explore various mathematical functions and algorithms, starting with basic calculations like square roots and progressing to more complex operations like finding prime numbers and calculating greatest common divisors, least common multiples, and finding factors.

### Square Root

The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. For example, the square root of $9$ is $3$ since $3 Ã— 3 = 9$.

To calculate the square root efficiently, we use the Newton-Raphson method, an iterative numerical technique for finding roots of real-valued functions. This method starts with an initial estimate and repeatedly refines it using the formula:

$$
x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2}(x_n + \frac{N}{x_n})
$$

Where:

- $x_n$ is the current estimate
- $N$ is the number we want to find the square root of
- $x_{n+1}$ is the improved estimate

This can be implemented in code as follows:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
double calculate_square_root(double x)
{
    double y;
    int p, square, c;

    // Find the first perfect square greater than the input number
    p = 0;
    do
    {
        p++;
        square = (p + 1) * (p + 1); // Calculate the next perfect square
    }
    while (x > square); // Stop when x is less than or equal to the square

    // Approximate the square root using the Newton-Raphson method
    y = (double)p;
    c = 0;
    while (c < 10) // Perform a maximum of 10 iterations
    {
        y = (x / y + y) / 2; // Update the guess by averaging x/y and y

        if (y * y == x) // Check if the square of the current guess matches the input
            return y; // If exact, return the square root

        c++;
    }

    return y;
}
```

    while (true)

### Prime Number

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check if a number is prime, you will need to also calculate the square root of the number. You can use the following functions to check if a number is prime:

To check if a number is prime, we can use a simple algorithm that checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root. The logic behind this approach is based on the following mathematical principles:

1. Any non-prime number $n$ can be written as a product of two factors: $n = a \times b$
2. If $n$ is not prime, at least one of these factors must be less than or equal to $\sqrt{n}$
3. If we can't find any factors up to $\sqrt{n}$, then the number must be prime

This can be implemented in code as follows:

```plaintext
Is 17 a prime number? Yes
```

```plaintext

```

### Finding Prime Numbers up to a Given Number

Finding prime numbers up to a given number is a common task in number theory and cryptography. The following function implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm, which efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified maximum $n$. The algorithm works by:

1. Creating a list of numbers from 2 to $n$
2. Starting with $p=2$ (the first prime), marking all multiples of $p$ up to $n$ as composite
3. Finding the next unmarked number and repeating step 2
4. The remaining unmarked numbers are prime

This can be expressed mathematically as finding all numbers $p$ where:

$$
p \in \{2,\ldots,n\} \text{ and } p \nmid k \text{ for all } k < p
$$

For example, to find primes up to 20, we would mark off:

- Multiples of 2: $4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20$
- Multiples of 3: $9, 15$
- Multiples of 5: none remaining
- Leaving primes: $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19$

```plaintext

```

### Finding the Number of Divisors

The number of divisors of a positive integer $n$ is the count of positive integers that divide $n$ without leaving a remainder. We can find the number of divisors efficiently by only checking up to $\sqrt{n}$ because divisors come in pairs.

For any divisor $d$ of $n$, there exists a corresponding divisor $\frac{n}{d}$ such that $d \times \frac{n}{d} = n$. For example, for $n=12$:

- When $d=1$, we get $\frac{n}{d}=12$
- When $d=2$, we get $\frac{n}{d}=6$
- When $d=3$, we get $\frac{n}{d}=4$

Therefore, except for perfect squares where $d=\sqrt{n}$, divisors occur in pairs. The total count can be calculated by:

$$
\text{divisors}(n) = 2 \times |\{d : d|\sqrt{n}\}| + |\{d : d^2=n\}|
$$

where $d|n$ denotes that $d$ divides $n$ evenly.

```

### Finding the Sum of Divisors

The sum of divisors of a positive integer is the sum of all positive integers that divide the number without leaving a remainder. This function calculates the sum of divisors of a given number by iterating through all numbers up to the square root of the input number and summing the divisors.

For a number $n$, finding the sum of its divisors involves:

1. Iterating through numbers from 1 to $\sqrt{n}$
2. For each divisor $d$, if $n$ is divisible by $d$:
    - If $d^2 = n$, add $d$ once
    - Otherwise, add both $d$ and $\frac{n}{d}$

For example, for $n=12$:

- Divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
- Sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28

This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\sum_{d|n} d = \sum_{d \leq \sqrt{n}} d \cdot [n \bmod d = 0] + \frac{n}{d} \cdot [d^2 \neq n]
$$

where $[P]$ is 1 if condition $P$ is true, and 0 otherwise.

### Greatest Common Divisor

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller number and replacing the larger number with the remainder until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD of the two numbers. This algorithm is known as the Euclidean algorithm which can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\text{GCD}(a,b) = \text{GCD}~(b, a \bmod b)
$$

where $a \bmod b$ represents the remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$.

You can use the following functions to calculate the GCD of two numbers:

```plaintext
The GCD of 24 and 15 is: 3
```

### Least Common Multiple

The least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both of those numbers. An efficient way to calculate the LCM is by using the relationship between the LCM and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of those numbers. The formula for finding the LCM using the GCD is:

$$
\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}

### Checking for Coprime Numbers

Two numbers are coprime (or relatively prime) if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is $1$. For example, $8$ and $15$ are coprime because their GCD is $1$, even though neither number is prime.

### Eulers Totient Function

Euler's totient function, denoted as $\phi(n)$, is a mathematical function that counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ that are coprime to $n$. For example, $\phi(8) = 4$ because the numbers $1, 3, 5,$ and $7$ are coprime to $8$.

The totient function can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\phi(n) = n \times \prod_{p|n} (1 - \frac{1}{p})
$$

Where:

- $p|n$ denotes that $p$ divides $n$ evenly
- The product is taken over all prime factors of $n$
- The formula can be simplified to:

$$
\phi(n) = n \times (1 - \frac{1}{p_1}) \times (1 - \frac{1}{p_2}) \times \ldots
$$

This can be implemented in code as follows:

1. First extracting all factors of $2$ (the smallest prime number)
2. Then checking odd numbers up to the square root for remaining factors

### Checking Congruence

Two numbers $a$ and $b$ are considered congruent modulo $m$ if they yield the same remainder when divided by $m$. This relationship is written mathematically as:

## Modular Arithmetic Operations

Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain valueâ€”the modulus. This section includes functions for modular addition, subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation. The function `modular_exponentiation` performs modular exponentiation, which raises a base to an exponent under a modulus efficiently. This operation is commonly used in cryptography and number theory.

:::tip
Modular arithmetic can be useful for solving problems involving cycles, such as clock calculations or repeating patterns. Itâ€™s also fundamental in cryptography, computer science algorithms, and number theory.
:::

### Modular Addition

Modular addition is the operation of adding two numbers and taking the remainder when divided by a modulus. This operation is useful in many applications, including cryptography and computer science.

Mathematically, modular addition can be expressed as:

$$
(a + b) \mod m
$$

where:

- $a$ and $b$ are the numbers to be added
- $m$ is the modulus
- $mod$ denotes the modulo operation, which finds the remainder after division of one number by another

For example, if we want to add $7$ and $5$ with a modulus of $10$, we calculate:

$$
(7 + 5) \mod 10 = 12 \mod 10 = 2
$$

This means that $7$ and $5$ add up to $12$, and when we take the remainder after dividing by $10$, we get $2$.

This can be implemented in code as follows:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
int modular_addition(int a, int b, int mod) {
    return (a + b) % mod;
}
```

int ModularAddition(int a, int b, int mod) {

```plaintext

```

If we swapped the value to be $15$ instead of $5$, the output would then be:

```plaintext

```

### Modular Subtraction

Modular subtraction is the operation of subtracting two numbers and taking the remainder when divided by a modulus. This operation is useful in many applications, including cryptography and computer science.

Mathematically, modular subtraction can be expressed as:

$$
(a - b) \mod m
$$

where:

- $a$ and $b$ are the numbers to be subtracted
- $m$ is the modulus
- $mod$ denotes the modulo operation, which finds the remainder after division of one number by another

For example, if we want to subtract $5$ from $7$ with a modulus of $10$, we calculate:

$$
(7 - 5) \mod 10 = 2 \mod 10 = 2
$$

This means that $7$ minus $5$ is $2$, and when we take the remainder after dividing by $10$, we get $2$.

This can be implemented in code as follows:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
int modular_subtraction(int a, int b, int mod) {
    return (a - b + mod) % mod;

```plaintext

```

```plaintext

```

### Modular Multiplication

Modular multiplication is the operation of multiplying two numbers and taking the remainder when divided by a modulus. This operation is useful in many applications, including cryptography and computer science.

Mathematically, modular multiplication can be expressed as:

$$
(a \times b) \mod m
$$

where:

- $a$ and $b$ are the numbers to be multiplied
- $m$ is the modulus
- $mod$ denotes the modulo operation, which finds the remainder after division of one number by another

For example, if we want to multiply $7$ and $5$ with a modulus of $10$, we calculate:

$$
(7 \times 5) \mod 10 = 35 \mod 10 = 5
$$

This means that $7$ multiplied by $5$ is $35$, and when we take the remainder after dividing by $10$, we get $5$.

This can be implemented in code as follows:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">

#### Using this function

You can use the `modular_multiplication` function to perform modular multiplication of two numbers. For example, to multiply $7$ and $5$ with a modulus of $10$:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
int result = modular_multiplication(7, 5, 10);
std::cout << "The result of modular multiplication is: " << result << std::endl;
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
int result = ModularMultiplication(7, 5, 10);
Console.WriteLine($"The result of modular multiplication is: {result}");
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python
result = modular_multiplication(7, 5, 10)
print(f"The result of modular multiplication is: {result}")
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Expected Output

After running the above code, the expected output should be:

```plaintext
The result of modular multiplication is: 5
```

If we swapped the value to be $15$ instead of $5$, the output would then be:

```plaintext
The result of modular multiplication is: 5
```

### Modular Exponentiation

Modular exponentiation is the operation of raising a base to an exponent and taking the remainder when divided by a modulus. This operation is useful in many applications, including cryptography and computer science.

Mathematically, modular exponentiation can be expressed as:

$$
\text{base}^{\text{exponent}} \mod m
$$

where:

- $\text{base}$ is the number to be raised to the power
- $\text{exponent}$ is the power to which the base is raised
- $m$ is the modulus
- $mod$ denotes the modulo operation, which finds the remainder after division of one number by another

For example, if we want to calculate $3^4$ with a modulus of $5$, we calculate:

$$
3^4 \mod 5 = 81 \mod 5 = 1
$$

This means that $3$ raised to the power of $4$ is $81$, and when we take the remainder after dividing by $5$, we get $1$.

This can be implemented in code as follows:

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
int modular_exponentiation(int base, int exponent, int mod) {
    int result = 1;
    base = base % mod;

    while (exponent > 0) {
        if (exponent % 2 == 1) {
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        exponent >>= 1;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
    }
    return result;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

```csharp
int ModularExponentiation(int base, int exponent, int mod) {
    int result = 1;
    base = base % mod;

    while (exponent > 0) {
        if (exponent % 2 == 1) {
            result = (result * base) % mod;
        }
        exponent >>= 1;
        base = (base * base) % mod;
    }
    return result;
}
```

            result = (result * base) % mod
